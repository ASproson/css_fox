# Fox Umbrellas

This repo is a recreation of [LAIN](https://dribbble.com/shots/24027033-Fox-Umbrellas-Luxury-Sophisticated-Website-Design-Concept)'s website design for a premium umbrella company, implemented with React using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. For this project I did not have access to the Figma or any of the used fonts/images, as such, some elements are close replications.

Additionally, there is no responsive/mobile design provided, so I implemented my own.
